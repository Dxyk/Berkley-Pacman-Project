  <h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
      <p>In this project, you will implement some new constraints and
      backtracking search algorithms.</p>
      <p>Note that this code base is unrelated to the Berkeley pacman
        code base. So you will not need any of the files from A1 nor
        A2.  (If anyone has a good idea as to how to use CSPs within
        the pacman framework please let us know).</p>
      <!-- <p>Unlike Assignment 1 and Assignment 2, no autograder is being released with this project.  -->
      <p>The code for this project contains the following files,
      available as a <a href="handout/csp.zip">zip archive.</a></p>

  <p><strong>Files to Edit and Submit:</strong> You will fill in
    portions of <code>backtraking.py</code>, <code>csp.py</code>,
    and <code>csp_problems.py</code> during the assignment.  You may
    also add other functions and code to these file so as to create a
    modular implementation. You will submit these file with your
    modifications. Please <em>do not</em> change the other files in
    this distribution.</p>

  <p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Your code will be autograded for
    technical correctness. The tests in <code>autograder.py</code>
    will be run as well as some additional tests. Please <em>do
    not</em> change the names of any provided functions or classes
    within the code, or you will wreak havoc on the autograder.
    </p>

  <p><strong>Getting Help:</strong> You are not alone! If you find
    yourself stuck on something, contact the course staff for
    help. There will be scheduled help sessions (to be announced), the
    piazza discussion forum will be monitored and questions answered,
    and you can also ask questions about the assignment during office
    hours. These things are for your support; please take advantage of
    them.  If you can't make our office hours, let us know and we will
    arrange a different appointment. We want the assignment to be
    rewarding and instructional, not frustrating and demoralizing. But,
    we don't know when or how to help unless you ask.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Piazza Discussion:</strong> <b>Please be careful not to post
      spoilers.</b></p>

  <h3><a name="Submit"></a>What to Submit</h3> You will be using MarkUs to
  submit your assignment. You will submit three files:
  <ol>
    <li>Your modified <code>backtracking.py</code>
    <li>Your modified <code>csp_problems.py</code>
    <li>Your modified <code>constraints.py</code>
    <li>A signed copy of the following <a href="acknowledgment_form.pdf">acknowledgment</a>
  </ol>  

<b>Note:</b> <font color=orange>In the various parts below we ask a
number of questions. You do not have to hand in answers to these
questions, rather these questions are designed to help you understand
the material.</font>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Autograder"></a>AutoGrader</h3>
<code>autograder.py</code> is not the same as the Berkeley autograder. You can only run the command<br><br>
<code>python autograder.py -q qn</code><br><br> where <code>qn</code>
is one
of <code>q1</code>, <code>q2</code>, <code>q3</code>, <code>q4</code>,
or <code>q5</code>.

<p>Or you can run the grader on all questions together with the command <br><br>
  <code>python autograder.py</code>

    <h3><a name="Welcome"></a>CSPs</h3>
    <hr>
  <div class="project">
    <h3><a name="Q1"></a>Question 1 (4 points): Implementing a Table Constraint</h3>
    <p><code>backtracking.py</code> already contains an implementation
    of BT (plain backtracking search) while
     <code>csp_problems.py</code> contains an implementation of the
    nQueens problem.  Try running <br><br><code>python nqueens.py
        8</code><br><br> to solve the 8 queens problem using BT. If you run
    <br><br><code>python nqueens.py -c 8</code><br><br> the program
    will find all solutions to the 8-Queens problem.

    Try <br><br><code>python nqueens.py --help</code><br><br> to see
    the other arguments you can use. (However, you haven't
    implemented FC nor GAC yet, so you can't use these algorithms yet.)

    Try some different small numbers with the '-c' option, to see how
    the number of solutions grows with the number of Queens. Also
    observe that even numbered queens are generally faster to solve,
    and the time to find a single solution for 'BT' grows quite
    quickly.

    Observe the number of nodes explored. Later once you have FC and
    GAC implemented you will see that they explore fewer nodes.

    <br><br> For this question look
    at <code>constraint.py</code>. There you will find the
    class <code>QueensTableConstraint</code> that you have to
    implement for this question. This class creates a table constraint
    to capture the nQueens constraint.  Once you have that implemented
    you can run
    <br><br><code>python nqueens.py -t 8</code><br><br> to solve the
    nQueens CSP using your table constraint implementation.  Check a
    number of sizes and '-c' options: you should get the same
    solutions returned irrespective of whether or not you use
    '-t'. That is, your table constraint should yield the same
    behavior as the original <code>QueensConstraint</code>
  <hr/>

  <div class="project">
    <h3><a name="Q2"></a>Question 2 (5 points): Forward Checking</h3>
    <p>In <code>backtracking.py</code> you will find the unfinished
      function <code>FC</code>. You have to complete this function.
      Note that the essential subroutine <code>FCCheck</code> has
      already been implemented for you.

      Note that your implementation must deal correctly with finding
      one or all solutions. Check how this is done in the already
      implemented <code>BT</code> algorithm...just be sure that you
      restore all pruned values even if <code>FC</code> is terminating
      after one solution.

      <p>After implementing <code>FC</code> you will be able to run
      <br><br><code>python nqueens.py -a FC 8</code><br><br> to solve
      8-Queens with forward checking. Solve some different sizes and
      check how the number of nodes explored differs from
      when <code>BT</code> is used.

      <br><br>Also try solving sudoku using the command<br><br><code>python sudoku.py 1</code><br><br>
      Which will solve board #1 using Forward Checking. Try other boards (1 to 7). Also try
      <br><br><code>python sudoku.py -a 'BT' 1</code><br><br> to see
      how BT performs compared to FC. Finally try
      <br><br><code>python sudoku.py -a 'FC' -c 1</code><br><br>
      To find all solutions using FC. Check if any of the boards 1-7 have more than one solution.

    <div class="project">
      <h3><a name="Q3"></a>Question 3 (7 points): GacEnforce and GAC</h3>
      <p>In <code>backtracking.py</code> you will find
      unfinished <code>GacEnforce</code> and <code>GAC</code>
        routines. Complete these functions.

        <p><font color=red>Please note that the GAC pseudo code on the
        lecture slides had a small bug. The bug has been fixed and the
        new lecture slides have been posted to the course website.</font>

      <p>After finishing these routines you will be able to run
        <br><br><code>python nqueens.py -a GAC 8</code><br><br> Try
        different numbers of Queens and see how the number of nodes
        explored differs from when you run <code>FC</code>.

      <p>Does <code>GAC</code> also take less time
      than <code>FC</code> on <code>sudoku</code>? What about
      on <code>nqueens</code>?

      <p>Now try running 
        <br><br><code>python sudoku.py -e 1</code><br><br> which will
       not do any backtracking search, it will only run 
        <code>GacEnforce</code>.

      <p>Try running only <code>GacEnforce</code> on each board to see
        which ones are solved by only doing <code>GacEnforce</code>.

    <div class="project">
      <h3><a name="Q4"></a>Question 4 (2 points): AllDiff for
      Sudoku</h3> In <code>csp_problems.py</code> you will find the
      function <code>sudokuCSP</code>. This function takes
      a <code>model</code> parameter that is either <code>'neq'</code>
      or <code>'alldiff'</code>. When <code>model == 'neq'</code> the
      returned CSP contains many binary not-equals constraints. But
      when <code>model == 'alldiff'</code> the model should contain 27
      allDifferent constraints.

      <p>Complete the implementation of <code>sudokuCSP</code> so it
      properly handles the case when <code>model == 'alldiff'</code>
        using allDifferent constraints instead of binary not-equals.

      <p>Note that this question is <b>very easy</b> as you can use
      the <code>class AllDiffConstraint(Constraint)</code> that is
      already implemented in <code>constraints.py</code>. However, you
      must successfully complete Question 3 to get any marks on this
      question.
    <hr/>

    <div class="project">
      <h3><a name="Q5"></a>Question 5 (4 points): NValues
      Constraint</h3> The <code>NValues</code> Constraint is a
      constraint over a set of variables that places a lower and an
      upper bound on the number of those variables taking on a
      specified value.

      <p>In <code>constraints.py</code> you will find an incomplete
      implementation of <code>class NValuesConstraint</code>. In
      particular, the function <code>hasSupport</code> has not yet
      been implemented. Complete this implementation. 
    <hr/>
    <h3>Submission</h3>
<p>You're not done yet! You will also need to submit your code and
   signed acknowledgment to MarkUs.</p>
